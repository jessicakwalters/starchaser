## About the Project

Dark parks are areas with little to no light pollution making them ideal places to view the stars. StarChaser is an application that makes it easy for the user to search for a dark park near the location the user specifies, and to know the stargazing "outlook" based on weather and the moon phase over the next 8 days.

## Feaures

Provides an eight-day weather and moonphase forecast of the park along with an outlook letting the user know at a glance whether or not to go stargazing. Users are also able to add more dark parks to the database so that the information is accessible by other users. StarChaser also has a page that renders information about NASA's Image of the Day.
