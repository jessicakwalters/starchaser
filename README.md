##About the Project

Dark parks are areas with little to no light pollution making them ideal places to view the stars. StarChaser is an application that makes it easier to search for a dark park near a location the user specifies.

##Feaures

Provides a seven day weather and moonphase forecast of the park along with an outlook letting the user know at a glance whether or not to go stargazing. Users are also able to add more dark parks to the databse so that the information is accessible by other users. Starchaser also has a page that renders information about NASA's Image of the day.
